# Program Ryze Tello with Python

There are multiple libraries that can be used to communicate with the Ryze Tello in Python, including:
* [TelloPy](https://github.com/hanyazou/TelloPy)
* [DJITelloPy](https://github.com/damiafuentes/DJITelloPy)

Both of the above libraries allow you to control the Tello drone, retrieve a video stream and receive and parse state packets. They also both include a few built-in examples:

TelloPy:
* [Simple takeoff](https://github.com/hanyazou/TelloPy/blob/develop-0.7.0/tellopy/examples/simple_takeoff.py)
* [Record log](https://github.com/hanyazou/TelloPy/blob/develop-0.7.0/tellopy/examples/record_log.py)
* [Video effect](https://github.com/hanyazou/TelloPy/blob/develop-0.7.0/tellopy/examples/video_effect.py)
* [Keyboard and video](https://github.com/hanyazou/TelloPy/blob/develop-0.7.0/tellopy/examples/keyboard_and_video.py)
* [Joystick and video](https://github.com/hanyazou/TelloPy/blob/develop-0.7.0/tellopy/examples/joystick_and_video.py)

DJITelloPy:
* [Simple](https://github.com/damiafuentes/DJITelloPy/blob/master/examples/simple.py)
* [Simple swarm](https://github.com/damiafuentes/DJITelloPy/blob/master/examples/simple-swarm.py)
* [Take picture](https://github.com/damiafuentes/DJITelloPy/blob/master/examples/take-picture.py)
* [Record video](https://github.com/damiafuentes/DJITelloPy/blob/master/examples/record-video.py)
* [Mission pads](https://github.com/damiafuentes/DJITelloPy/blob/master/examples/mission-pads.py)
* [Manual control pygame](https://github.com/damiafuentes/DJITelloPy/blob/master/examples/manual-control-pygame.py)
* [Manual control OpenCV](https://github.com/damiafuentes/DJITelloPy/blob/master/examples/manual-control-opencv.py)
